#### Code the following app

#### Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a time and then plays a sound when that time is reached  
#### ```

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The following files are the ones that will most likely need to be edited or added to satisfy your requests:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – to update the `title` and `description` used for the app metadata and logo generation.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – to create the image description that will be turned into the app logo.  
3. **time_sound.py** (new file) – a standalone Python script that prompts the user for a time and plays a sound when that time is reached.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks (or new‑file blocks) for the changes.

A stylized analog clock face with a digital display showing the target time, surrounded by a subtle sound wave icon radiating outward. The background is a calm gradient of blue tones, giving the image a modern, tech‑friendly feel. The clock hands point to the specified time, and the sound wave is centered to emphasize the audio aspect of the app.

time_sound.py

A simple script that prompts the user for a target time (HH:MM:SS) and plays a sound
when that time is reached. The script uses the `playsound` library to play an
audio file named `alert.wav` located in the same directory. If the target time
has already passed, the script will notify the user and exit.
